	<p id="forindent">No one can deny that technology is an absolute need in our daily lives. We are all so reliant on technology that we can't imagine life without it. We need technology at every step of the way, from laptops to staying fit. Technology allows us to communicate with those who are physically apart from us. We communicate with them via telephones and computers, and we can even see them. Our office work is likewise heavily reliant on technology. People no longer finish their work with a pen and paper. Going to the gym helps us maintain our health. The gym has machines that can help us lose weight and stay in shape.</p><br><br><br><p id="last">
Technology is an inescapable need that we cannot avoid; it plays a significant part in almost every aspect of our life. In other words, it provides solutions to the majority of humanity's issues. Technology advances throughout ages. The goal of technology, in whatever shape it takes, is to make it as easy to use as possible. It constantly points in the direction of ease in life. Take, for example, mobile technology. The more quickly the world moves, the more high-end features are available. The laptop is becoming thinner and smaller. Every year, it gets smaller while increasing its capabilities and performance. It should be able to load a large number of items in a more compact format. That is the requirement. Because everything is already "filed" in the laptop, people should not waste time thinking about what should be carried to a sales presentation in the southern state. Also applicable to the telephone. The need to be able to communicate at any time and from any location prompted scientists to develop the cellular phone. It's getting smaller and smaller. Then it got better, with more functions, games, and entertainment, and it became more professional, like having a computer in your pocket. Then, from expensive, it becomes cheaper, better, and faster, as well as more dependable. The indisputable relevance of technology in our everyday lives has prompted scientists to make advances from time to time through the tools and technologies they have produced for us to use in order to make our lives easier. We have a tendency to always be one step ahead. Technology can assist with not just the present but also with forecasting the future. It has the ability to assess possible earnings and losses. We can then make preparations and a list of precautionary steps for our descendants' future based on these.</p>
